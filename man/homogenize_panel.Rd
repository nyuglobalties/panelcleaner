\title{Homogenize all waves to consistent structure}
\usage{
homogenize_panel(panel, mapping = NULL, ...)

bind_waves(panel, allow_issues = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{panel}{An unhomogenized panel}

\item{mapping}{A panel mapping. If NULL, a panel mapping must be attached
to the \code{panel} object using \code{add_mapping()}}

\item{...}{Parameters to be used for context, usually for defining a panel
schema}

\item{allow_issues}{If \code{TRUE}, will allow waves to be bound together even if
there are identified issues. Use caution with this!}
}
\value{
An \code{unhomogenized_panel} that is ready to be homogenized using
\code{bind_waves()}
}
\description{
Once all waves are collected into a single \code{unhomogenized_panel} object, this
will homogenize variable names and, where applicable, categorical codings
according to a panel mapping.
